# Milestone Project #1
(User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project)

# A personal portfolio site

https://pavzel.github.io/pavzel-cv-2020-01/

# 1. Overview
The site is for recruiters that may want to hire me.
I've been working as a researcher and now is looking for a programmer job.
The site demonstrates my skills in HTML and CSS in the middle of January 2020.

# 2. UX
The site was supposed to contain only essential information.
For simpler view different topics are presented on separate pages directly accessible via menu.
The header contains my photo, name and contact information.
The footer contains brief "About Me" information, a link to a pdf file with my CV, and "Contacts".
All pages are supposed to occupy the entire browser window and preferably to have no vertical scroll bar.
The design was changed several times during the project development (see older versions in GitHub).

# 3. Features
# 3.1. Existing Features
The site contains 5 main pages with basic information about me:
1) My strong sides ("Home" page).
2) My education ("Education" page).
3) My work experience ("Work Experience" page). On "Work Experience" page there are inks to two lists of scientific papers published by me, for those who are interested in details of what I worked with and what I can do.
4) My programming skills ("Programming Skills" page).
5) Other possibly relevant information ("Other" page).
6) A downloadable CV in pdf format ("Download CD (pdf)" menu button).

Also each page contains contact information.
# 3.2. Features Left to Implement
In the future, when there are any completed projects then I may include a page "My Projects" with links to them instead of the current "Other" page.

# 4. Technologies Used
The project is written with HTML5 and CSS3.
For basic layout Bootstrap framework was used.
The default Bootstrap properties were modified with custom CSS.

# 5. Testing
1) The site was designed to look best on a desktop screen but was also adapted to other screen sizes including mobile phones.
It was tested with Inspect tool in Google Chrome for screen width from 330px to 1466px.
Also it was tested on a laptop Lenovo ThinkPad and a phone Motorola XT1941 4.
2) All menu buttons were tested.
3) All links on all pages were tested.

# 6. Deployment
The project is deployed to GitHub Pages (built from the master branch):

The source files are publicly accessible:

# 7. Credits
My photo is a private file.
Pdf scans of my documents are made by me.
Pdf files with my published papers are my private author copies.
The project design was inspired by a similar CV page from the Fullstack Web Developer course by Code Institute.
